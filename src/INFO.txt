How dungeons work...


There is a sign with
	-
	-  [Dungeon]
	-     f(floor)
	-
	
	EX:
	-
	-  [Dungeon]
	-	f(1)
	-
	
	The floor is just the id but you get the point

Right click the sign to try to join with your party

IF the dungeon is in progress, join denied
ELSE the party joins, the dungeon starts, joining disabled


After join Dungeon starts

dungeon enters waves
Spawns new wave every (wavedelay) with (waveamount) of (custom mobs) until waves hit 0.

dungeon enters boss
After waves hit 0, boss appears with the a repeat of the last wave

On boss death, dungeon enters end
Chest spawns at (chest spawn) with (rewards) contents

After the (kick timer) runs out, players are ejected from the dungeon to the entrance

Dungeon becomes joinable again
